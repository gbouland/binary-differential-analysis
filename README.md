## Differential analysis of binarized single-cell RNA sequencing data captures biological variation 

Single-cell RNA sequencing data is characterized by a large number of zero counts, yet there is growing evidence that these zeros reflect biological variation rather than technical artifacts. We propose to use binarized expression profiles to identify the effects of biological variation in single-cell RNA sequencing data. Using 16 publicly available and simulated datasets, we show that a binarized representation of single-cell expression data accurately represents biological variation and reveals the relative abundance of transcripts more robustly than counts.
